# GRAIN_Pipeline

Genome Retrieval, Annotation & INtegration. 

A multi-part walkthrough to guide you through using my scripts for the automated bulk download of NCBI genomes, their genome annotation, and incorporating everything into the lab [MycoTools](https://github.com/xonq/mycotools) database.

This walkthrough is designed for SCINet users in the arsef project.
